To preview the "Earn Your Screen" iOS app, you'll need a Mac with Xcode installed (version 14+ recommended for iOS 16+ support). Since your workspace is on Windows, you'll need to copy the files to a Mac. Here's the step-by-step process:

## 1. Transfer Files to Mac
- Copy the entire `EarnYourScreen` folder from your Windows machine to a Mac (via USB, cloud storage, or network share).
- Place it in a convenient location, e.g., `~/Desktop/EarnYourScreen`.

## 2. Create Xcode Project
On the Mac:
1. Open Xcode.
2. Select **File > New > Project**.
3. Choose **App** under iOS.
4. Set:
   - **Product Name**: EarnYourScreen
   - **Interface**: SwiftUI
   - **Language**: Swift
   - **Storage**: None (we'll replace with our code)
5. Choose a location (e.g., `~/Desktop/EarnYourScreenProject`).
6. Click **Create**.

## 3. Replace Project Files
1. In Finder, navigate to your new Xcode project folder.
2. Delete the default `EarnYourScreenApp.swift` and `ContentView.swift`.
3. Copy all files from your scaffolded `EarnYourScreen` folder into the Xcode project folder, preserving the structure.
4. In Xcode, right-click the project navigator > **Add Files to "EarnYourScreen"** > Select all the copied folders/files > **Add**.

## 4. Add Extension Targets
For the Screen Time extensions:
1. In Xcode, **File > New > Target**.
2. Choose **Device Activity Monitor Extension** (for monitoring).
3. Name: `DeviceActivityMonitorExtension`.
4. Repeat for **Device Activity Report Extension** (name: `DeviceActivityReportExtension`).
5. Replace the default extension files with your scaffolded ones from `Extensions/`.

## 5. Configure Entitlements
For Screen Time APIs:
1. Select the main app target > **Signing & Capabilities**.
2. Add **Family Controls** capability.
3. Add **App Groups** (create a group like `group.com.yourname.EarnYourScreen`).
4. Do the same for extension targets.
5. In each target's **Info.plist**, add:
   - `NSFamilyControlsUsageDescription`: "This app uses Screen Time to monitor learning apps."
   - `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription`: If needed for tracking.

## 6. Build & Run
1. Select an iOS Simulator (e.g., iPhone 15) or connect a device.
2. Click the **Run** button (▶️) or **Product > Run**.
3. The app should launch in the simulator/device.

## Notes
- **Screen Time APIs** require iOS 15+ and physical device testing (simulators don't support Family Controls).
- For full functionality, you'll need to set up Family Sharing on the device.
- If you encounter build errors, check that all imports are correct and frameworks are linked (FamilyControls, DeviceActivity, ManagedSettings).
- The app uses placeholder data, so you can interact with the UI immediately.
